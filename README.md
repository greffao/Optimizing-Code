**Abstract:** This repository contains the work developed in the **SSC0951 - Development of Optimized Code** course. The topics covered in the course were:
- **Code optimization techniques:** Processor-independent techniques, processor-dependent techniques, hot code detection,
- **Profiling:** Objectives, methodologies, and tools.
- **Application Acceleration:** Simple optimizations; Compilation optimizations; Code vectorization; Optimized libraries; Data access optimizations.
- **Secure code development:** Buffer overflow prevention, string formatting prevention, integer overflow prevention.
- **Reliable code development:** Practices for developing reliable code.
